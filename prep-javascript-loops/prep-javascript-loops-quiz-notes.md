  The initialization expression is evaluated once before the loop starts running.
- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  The conditional expression is evaluated once before each iteration of the loop, including after the initialization expression and each time the final expression runs.
- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  The final expression of a for loop is evaluated after the work of the loop is complete.
