## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the principal use of arrays?
  The principal use of an array in javascript is to store multiple items. Items can include numbers, strings, booleans, or even possibly other arrays.
- Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.
  The variable is created first, followed by assigning it a value starting with an open bracket symbol "[", following the list of items, ending with a closing bracket symbol "]".
  const arrayName = [
  "item 1" (denoted by 0)
  "item 2" (denoted by 1)
  "item 3" (denoted by 2)
  "item 4" (denoted by 3)
  "item 5" (denoted by 4)
  ];

- What number represents the **first** index of an array?
  0
- How can you access the last element of an array?
  The last element of an array is denoted by the amount of items listed minus 1, because all element lists in arrays begin with 0. For example, if there are 6 items in an array list, the final element would be denoted, and therefore accessed by using [5].
