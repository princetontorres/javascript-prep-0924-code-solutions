## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What tags are necessary for a complete HTML Skeleton?
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title> <body>
- What type of content belongs within the `<head>` of an HTML document?
  The "head" of an HTML document consists of information about the document. Things that are present in the "head" are not displayed on the page itself. For example, data such as character encoding types are included here.
- What type of content belongs within the `<body>` of an HTML document?
  The "body" of an HTML document consists of the majority of the content present in the document. The content placed in the "body" includes structured and embedded content, along with forms for interactive control.
- Where must the `DOCTYPE` declaration appear in a valid HTML document?
  The "DOCTYPE" declaration must be the very first thing present in an HTML document, otherwise the document type will be unknown, thus not making it a valid HTML document.
